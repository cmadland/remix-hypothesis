So far I have had feedback from one student who said she found the book to be clearly written and interesting. The original commercial textbook is ultimately more comprehensive and better written and therefore easier to design the on-line sociology course around. On the other hand, it costs over $150 dollars and is practically useless afterwards. There were also annoying ways in which the discipline of sociology was presented in the commercial textbook, which I was able to correct in the OER textbook.   I was the one who adapted the OER textbook from an original American version of the OER and I was also the one who rewrote and re designed the on-line course based on the OER book, so I can say that the book suits the courses purposes more or less perfectly. The only problem was that the original American OER textbook was so weak that I had to write two editions of the Canadian adaptation before the book was remotely acceptable. There is still a lot of room for improvement in the book, but for a single author revising it  is extremely time consuming and there is no financial incentive to do it. Theoretically, there are models of group authorship that might emerge to address the issue of how to continue to revise and improve it, but I haven't seen these develop yet.  One issue is that we had to open the new version of Soci 1111 (based on the new OER textbook) to students before the Second Edition went through a thorough external editing process, so potentially students are going to encounter problems in the text. The editing has been held up for unknown reasons for 2 or 3 months now. There is also an issue with the formatting of the book, because when the pdf version of the book is generated from the pressbooks format it was composed in, pictures and text get moved around in a way that will undoubtedly cause confusion for readers.

The course has only been running for a few weeks and I have only seen 1 or 2 assignments based on the course. ,Somewhat Worse,"See my previous comments. The commercial textbook that we used for Soci 1111 was very comprehensive and up to date. It covered a lot of empirical studies and conventional sociological material that are useful as examples for students written assignments, so it served well as a textbook for the course. It is a book by four well established Canadian sociologists and has been revised through multiple editions and is therefore a kind of a gold standard textbook. I think the new OER textbook serves the purpose for the course and will improve as it goes through revisions, but the American OER source that it was adapted from was extremely substandard for the level of study expected in Canadian universities. ",Yes,Yes,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,2,2,2,"I'm not sure what the question about ""I now use OER study to develop my teaching"" is about. What is ""OER study""?",Very supportive. ,No,"The support for redesigning the Soci 1111 and 1211 courses for the new OER textbook was helpful. I'm not sure if that is matter of ""policy"" or not. ","None. Very supportive. I would note that the labour to adapt the textbook first from the American source and then for the intro sociology courses far exceeded the amount I was paid by both BCCampus and TRUOL. If TRU wants to support the adapting and writing of OER textbooks some thought has to go in to how the labour involved in doing this is going to be funded. For full time on-campus faculty, this might be part of the expectations for research and publishing, but for TRUOL faculty paid on contract some sort of realistic payment model needs to be found.",I've seen it and I know what it means,Very important,Few impediments for students to access higher education. ,"No, but I share them with colleagues or others when asked.",,"If we are talking about the course materials rather than the OER textbook, nobody has asked to see them or use them for one (except for the other OLFM who teaches this course).
