# Faculty scholarship
* open work has become scholarly work towards P&T
* allows bipartite faculty to show their work
* increased opportunity for scholarly practice in teaching and learning (libraries, centre for T&L, video/media production)
* when OE is seen as scholarly practice, there is less argument about cost
* increased conference presentations and costs, but not seen as expense because it is scholarly
