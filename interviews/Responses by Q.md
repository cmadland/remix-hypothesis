### Have you used OER in the classroom? If not, why not? If so…
* No, because all of my teaching these days is online. I have, however, used OERs in the online environment.
* "Yes. But mostly just creative commons images. 
* I haven’t really found any (or current) OER for the very few instruction classes that I have taught, which tend to be quite specialized.
* My role is more about helping faculty to find OER"
* "I have used OERs many times in my teaching, as an ESL teacher and elementary school teacher. As an instructional designer, I often look at the open textbooks from BC Campus to see if there are any that apply to my courses.  
* I also search for open images and other online material to enhance or supplement the main text. "
* I do not teach students but I have incorporated OER in distance courses I have designed
* Yes. My two introductory on-line sociology courses have been recently rewritten to use a new OER Ontro to Sociology textbook. One of the original textbooks for these two courses was extremely expensive, about $150 for the whole book, although the publisher’s custom book for the course was probably somewhat cheaper. The book for the other course was reasonably priced, but still, the OER book is free to students removing one level of financial impediment to access to education.  I might not have changed the course myself because it had already been recently revised and updated and was working well, but there was an institutional push from the then dean of arts to use the OER textbook. 
* "Yes 
  * free easily accessible to everybody 
  * no copyright
  * more important because publishers tighter
  * important to students"
* "Yes. 
  * ability to modify according to current issues and interests
  * ability to work thematically (Truth and reconciliation commission)
  * get bored with someone else’s text, as do students"

###Please explain how you are using open web technologies or open education resources to engage your students.
* Our course textbook will be changed soon to an open textbook. I teach as well for RRU, where I was able to post in Moodle more OER material as it appeared relevant.
* n/a
* "In selecting any materials for a course, I consider how it will engage students, enhance their understanding of the content, and help them meet the course learning outcomes. 
* Selecting OERs is no different in that we use best practices of course design, including providing meaningful, accessible resources to help students engage in the course."
* I send students to interact with high-quality OER available etc view an open video or listen to an open podcast. I encourage students to share their knowledge, reflections and creative work with others in a blog or via Wikimedia Commons etc. and use open tools, including social media tools.
* There are some OER podcasts and educational materials in the on-line courses designed to give either more accessible elaboration on key concepts to consolidate student understand or illustrations of concepts to allow students to apply concepts, or see how they are applied.
* "example from BCCampus OTB; tell students to study the section at the end of the chapter and that it is important material. some of the q’s in the section will be copied to the exam, resulting in increased engagement and more students reading the section.
* student projects are released under a CC license (they choose which one), leading to increased engagement with CC licensing. Groups decide and report on the rationale.
* students are thinking about CC as a viable option vs copyright
* closed systems become uncomfortable
* what is a university?
* what constitutes production and dissemination of knowledge?
* traditional practices mitigate against production and dissemination of knowledge"
* "more academic dishonesty with commercial resources, b/c too many students were going through the course
* students couldn’t cheat with OTB
* ‘Tribe called Red’ group
  * watch group perform
  * easier access to multi-media & students could hear actual voices"
