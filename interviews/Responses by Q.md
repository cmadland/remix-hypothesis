### Have you used OER in the classroom? If not, why not? If so…
* No, because all of my teaching these days is online. I have, however, used OERs in the online environment.
* "Yes. But mostly just creative commons images. 
* I haven’t really found any (or current) OER for the very few instruction classes that I have taught, which tend to be quite specialized.
* My role is more about helping faculty to find OER"
* "I have used OERs many times in my teaching, as an ESL teacher and elementary school teacher. As an instructional designer, I often look at the open textbooks from BC Campus to see if there are any that apply to my courses.  
* I also search for open images and other online material to enhance or supplement the main text. "
* I do not teach students but I have incorporated OER in distance courses I have designed
* Yes. My two introductory on-line sociology courses have been recently rewritten to use a new OER Ontro to Sociology textbook. One of the original textbooks for these two courses was extremely expensive, about $150 for the whole book, although the publisher’s custom book for the course was probably somewhat cheaper. The book for the other course was reasonably priced, but still, the OER book is free to students removing one level of financial impediment to access to education.  I might not have changed the course myself because it had already been recently revised and updated and was working well, but there was an institutional push from the then dean of arts to use the OER textbook. 
* "Yes 
** free easily accessible to everybody 
** no copyright
** more important because publishers tighter
** important to students"
* "Yes. 
** ability to modify according to current issues and interests
** ability to work thematically (Truth and reconciliation commission)
** get bored with someone else’s text, as do students"
