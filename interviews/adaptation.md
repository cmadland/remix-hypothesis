# Adaptation
* And because faculty can customize them to their needs, 
* Because I primarily use CC images in my teaching, I modify or remix them 
* maybe add a comment, combine a few sources and remix them, or change the wording.
* There is the time needed to create/adapt/ maintain them. 
* What I would like to do is have students continue to modify and expand on OERs – add to the knowledge creation.  
* Perhaps just in how I search for resources. I also consider how I can share my own teaching resources, so am just starting to share more online and intend to make more adaptable OERs for teachers and learning designers. 
* Yes, very often. Most teachers need to adapt materials to bring in their own context, modify for students’ needs/levels, incorporate current events, etc.
* Adding context for students, applying directly to unit learning outcome, adding images, etc.
* I try to look for any application of OERs to my courses.  There is not always a fit or there may be other barriers, such as the writer requesting publisher resources. 
* Encouraging adaptations, modifications, rebranding etc, sharing widely for reuse, making revisions based on feedback from others, contextualizing resources eg making content for specific audience such as Aboriginal students
* version control if adaptations made,
* took Saylor art course and replaced images with copyright compliant ones, made course less American and more global/diverse in focus.
* Or one can divide one 3 credit course into 3 mini courses.
* More choice and flexibility.
* The first Canadian edition of the OER textbook was adapted for Canadian students from an extremely week and essentially unusable American OER textbook. The first edition had to be further revised to be able to support an on-line course as the principle resource for the students. (For an in-class course lectures might have been sufficient to add to the 1st edition textbook). 
* It has allowed me to customize the material in the course to suit my understanding of what the key introductory concepts of the discipline are.
* nothing ever fits
* get students to engage in adapting
* ability to modify according to current issues and interests
* more flexible and efficient than closed
* able to be more focussed and use my own examples
* more flexibility to prepare in las minute app’ts
* adapt out of necessity, no alternative
