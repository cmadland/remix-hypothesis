# New Mindset
* Understanding what it really meant â€“ what it included. How it really is a different mindset
* there would be many factors that would change (e.g. providing more context for those not familiar with the TRU-OL format, more discussions with writers on accessible wording, assessment strategies that are less likely to be copied, ensuring all resources are open, etc
* new open processes and mindset about working with others,
* OTB require a conceptual shift and work and faculty engagement
