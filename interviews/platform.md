# Platform
* I’m currently revising a course so that it will have an open textbook and I’m increasingly sensitive to Open questions. Trying to create the right educational space online for openness to succeed is proving to be a much bigger task than it first appeared to be.
* Cost of building the infrastructure to create and support them – e.g., software costs to create the OER; technical infrastructure to organize and store them. 
* Another challenge can be the format of the files, as it should be easy to adapt.
* it is encouraging to see resource sharing and collaborations go beyond the classrooms and schools, to an online sharing space accessible to all.   
* I encourage students to share their knowledge, reflections and creative work with others in a blog or via Wikimedia Commons etc. and use open tools, including social media tools.
* Source files could be a barrier…not easily accessible,
* closed systems become uncomfortable
* they were frustrated with the size of the book due to too much scrolling and no ToC
