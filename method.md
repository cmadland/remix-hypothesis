This study uses a mixed methods design combining the predictive power of quantitative data analysis with the explanatory power of qualitative analysis. The analyses from each type of data will be compared and synthesized into a coherent statement summarizing the similarities and differences with respect to the two methods.

Participants in the study will include six different populations, including distance students, campus students, distance teaching faculty, campus teaching faculty, faculty instructional designers, and administrators. Given the relatively small size of Thompson Rivers University, results will be compared to data gathered by BCcampus and the Open Education Resource Hub in the United Kingdom.

**Data Collection**

Campus and distance students will be surveyed to determine how much they typically spend on required and optional resources per semester, how required and optional resources are used to support learning, how their attainment of learning outcomes is affected by the resources that they use, and how they perceive the quality of their resources.

Campus faculty will be surveyed to determine how much they typically require students to spend on required and optional resources per semester, how they use required and optional materials for learning, how student learning outcomes are affected by the resources that they use and how they perceive the quality of the required and optional resources that they use.

Distance faculty will be surveyed to determine their perceptions on the quality and effectiveness of OER/OTB in relation to traditional resources.

Instructional designers will be interviewed to determine how their design decisions were influenced by the use of OER/OTB.

Administrators will be surveyed to determine their perceptions of OER.

All groups will be asked how they perceive the quality of OER/OTB in relation to traditionally licensed materials.
