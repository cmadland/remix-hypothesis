# OEP
* OERs are one thing; open pedagogy is another. BlackBoard Learn and Moodle create their own limitations, as does our ‘continuous entry’ model. I’d like to be able to interact more with the students as they find their way through the OERs but the self-paced, non-cohort-based features of our courses make that difficult-to-impossible.
* Probably – because it may be seen by others.
* More constructivist approaches to go with OER use. 
* There are some OER podcasts and educational materials in the on-line courses designed to give either more accessible elaboration on key concepts to consolidate student understand or illustrations of concepts to allow students to apply concepts, or see how they are applied.
* I had my third year in-class students collectively write a chapter on religion for the OER textbook, which will then be a resource for future 1st year students
* Maybe. The example I mentioned in question 3 required students to write 4 or 5 paragraphs of publishable material. It was a back and forth process of me doing some very active editing and returning the work to the students for revision. The outcome brought all the students who made the final cut into the A range. So yes, for many it was higher quality work at the end of the process.
* I rewrote the original American OER textbook, replacing the American information and perspective with Canadian material. Tried different methods, from complete revision to produce as close as possible the ideal introductory textbook chapter on a certain topic (very time consuming, exceeding budget by a large margin),  to quick and dirty, holding nose, style of just changing the information and place references (faster but unsatisfactory product), to revising using a mini-crowd-sourcing, student-author, collective process to rewrite a chapter (see #3). The latter was more satisfying, produced better results than the quick and dirty approach, but was also involved an incredibly time consuming editorial process to plan, manage and work on revisions (not to mention the time put in by individual students). 
* example from BCCampus OTB; tell students to study the section at the end of the chapter and that it is important material. some of the q’s in the section will be copied to the exam, resulting in increased engagement and more students reading the section.
* increased engagement with teaching practices
* more engagement with the curriculum
* get students to engage in adapting
* multiple representations and dual coding is more engaging
