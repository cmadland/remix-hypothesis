# Purpose of the Study


The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of open licensing on how faculty, instructional designers and students use OER compared to how they use commercially prepared resources. Based on the presumption that simply adopting OER in place of commercial resources without changing learning activities to take advantage of the affordances of OER is unlikely to lead to significant improvements in learning outcomes, aside from the moderate benefits of early access to up-to-date materials. Furthermore, changed practice is unlikely to occur if OER are deployed in closed platforms, such as proprietary learning management systems.

A secondary purpose is to investigate the perceptions of faculty, instructional designers, students, and administrators in relation to OER use and adoption.

The third purpose is to offer suggestions for how to promote open pedagogical practices in light of increasing levels of OER adoption.
