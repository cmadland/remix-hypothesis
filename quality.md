# Quality
* students may have more dynamic resources to use.
* Challenges in selecting OERs are the quality of resources available,
* We want to continue to improve online resources that represent various perspectives and are free from bias. By introducing students to OERs, we can encourage them to critically evaluate resources, add to the discussion, correct mistakes or biases, create new OERs, etc. 
* Getting faculty to review OER, believe OER quality could be good, 
* currency
* more feedback.
* More easy and regular “editing” and “revising” based on feedback.
* Maybe. The example I mentioned in question 3 required students to write 4 or 5 paragraphs of publishable material. It was a back and forth process of me doing some very active editing and returning the work to the students for revision. The outcome brought all the students who made the final cut into the A range. So yes, for many it was higher quality work at the end of the process.
* yes, but only sr. students who understand open. 1st yrs, no.
