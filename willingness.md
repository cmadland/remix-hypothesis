# Willingness
* As an instructional designer, I would say the key is having the course writer (subject matter expert), who is willing to try OERs, or is already an OER user/promoter. Most often, the course writer has an idea of the resources they want to use in the course, so as much as we share other possible resources, we typically end up choosing the publisher resources they use in their face-to-face classes.
